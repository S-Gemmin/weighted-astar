This repository showcases the implementation of weighted A* pathfinding algorithm in Unity for 2D games. 
Unlike traditional A* algorithm, weighted A* takes into account the weights of nodes and edges in a grid 
and assigns them a value based on their desirability. For example, if there is water in the grid, it might 
not be completely unwalkable, but it can be set to have a higher weight, making it less desirable for game 
characters to traverse. This approach can result in more realistic and efficient movement for game characters.
